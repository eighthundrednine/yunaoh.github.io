#PERSONAL GOD STORY
For a long time I've thought about whether or not I should or could post about my faith. I worried that it would color the rest of what I had to say in a weird religious gloss...blur all my crisp wit and poignant observations with the fuzziness of faith.

The point of this blog is to highlight the things of love and of hope in this world; to make a case for the right things and to think about the wrong things; to consider if and when and how one should go about redeeming or reconciling or restoring, or minimally, thinking about the broken things of this world. 

I'm still worried that there may be a blurring of things...a fuzzifying of things that are crystal clear to me. But my confession is that there is no other starting point: my personal god story. 

<span style="color: #ff6f69;">
I always went to church. I had seen glimpses of what "knowing God" could do to someone ...and for someone. I had seen a handful of both small and radical changes take place in the hearts of my parents and other close family friends. However, my first true encounter with God occurred in the winter of sixth grade. 

On the last night of my youth group's winter retreat, I sat quietly watching as the majority of my peers prayed - seriously prayed. I caught bits and pieces of other peoples' prayers as I tried to focus on what I wanted to say to the "up there" and it surprised me at how deeply they were sharing and what kinds of struggles they were addressing in their prayers. 

I had grown up praying before going to sleep and before meals. I knew the right things to say and I believed those words to be helpful and harmless. But *these* prayers were different and my friends were on their KNEES in prayer communicating their life stories with One they believed to be their Creator. 

That night I was humbled. I had grown up without a rebellious bone in my body. I was always obedient and tried to set a good example for my younger brother and cousins. I was a "good kid." That night I came to realize, however, that much of my identity was formed through the maintenance of a good-girl-facade. I wanted to meet personally this God to whom my friends, pastors, and Bible study teachers were bearing their souls and problems and deepest insecurities. 

So without really knowing what to expect, I asked God to show me what I had not seen before and to meet me where I was because I was just too small and too lost to know how to begin to look for Him. He did.

If God had created the world in all of its magnificence and simply walked away in satisfaction, God would have little personal relevance in my life. Nothing about a created world left behind begets a relationship.

God created the world and saw that it was good and wanted a relationship with every part of His creation. That tie was severed when humanity, at the first opportunity to exercise the CHOICE to love God in return, chose to disobey God. Time and time again humanity yielded to the most base parts of their desires. So, the "right" life had to be demonstrated. 

To reconcile humanity back to Himself, God sent His one and only son, Jesus Christ, to the world to live in perfect accordance with His will. Jesus loved God and with God's heart loved others, served the despised, cared for the weak, encouraged the broken, and restored the devastated. He subordinated himself to the most despicable people in humility. Jesus Christ lived each day with reverence for God and love for mankind and the entire created world. 

The perfect demonstration of God's character, heart, and creativity on earth - Jesus - stood in place of the rest of humanity to bear the consequences of mankind's rebellion and idolatry. God's pain wholly absorbed in the life of Christ, we are able to freely participate in a loving relationship with our Creator. 

These things have slowly sculpted my character and my life choices to reflect those of Jesus Christ. 

Of course, I am far from loving others as completely, selflessly, and generously as Jesus Christ. 
But my life has been infiltrated for the better.</span>
