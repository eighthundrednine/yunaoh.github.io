excerpt: that breathes on earth the air of paradise...

#YES!
hope may with my strong desire keep pace, <br>
And I be undeluded, unbetrayed: <br>
For if of our affections none find grace <br>
In sight of Heaven, then wherefore hath God made <br>
The world which we inhabit? <span style="color: #556b2f;">**Better plea** </span><br>
Love cannot have, than that in loving thee <br>
Glory to that eternal peace is paid, <br>
Who such divinity to thee imparts <br>
As hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts. <br>
His hope is treacherous only whose love dies <br>
With beauty, which is varying every hour; <br>
But, in chaste hearts uninfluenced by the power <br>
Of outward change, there blooms a deathless flower, <br>
That breathes on earth the air of paradise. <br>
Michelangelo
